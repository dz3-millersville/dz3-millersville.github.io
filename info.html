		An infographic is an image which combines graphics, images, and text to convey information about a particular topic or subject. Infographics can often be used to help illustrate relational connections between ideas or topics through the passage of time, cause and effect, or another graphical communication technique.
		<br><br>
		We were tasked with creating an infographic based on an communication technology of our choosing, leading to a variety of different topics and subjects. I chose to have my infographic illustrate the relationship between physical book printing and innovations in the world of digital communications.

		<p>
		In review of my infographic, I see areas where I played things safe alongside some places of risk. Looking from the top down, I think the most clear-cut thing that stands out to me was the risk in the topic of my infographic. Given our initial criteria, choosing to forgo a simpler examination of a communication technology in favor of a relational topic such as physical printing and digital innovations led to a project with more risk of failing under greater complexity.
		<br><br>
		On the other hand, I feel like my focus on a single aspect of this technological relationship meant that my infographic was slightly simplier than it could have been. The timeline structure was beneficial to illustrating change over time, but I feel like I was very minimal in my use of that structure. I could've added more detail in this regard.
		<br><br>
		Overall I am decently happy with how this project turned out.
